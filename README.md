# odin-recipes
This project is called odin-recipes and it is my first project!
This project aimed to create a simple chocolate chip cookie recipe in HTML. This project uses code such as headings (<h1>,<h2>,<h3>, etc.), ordered and unordered lists (<ol> and <ul>) and also includes an image (<img src="image.jpg">).
You can alter this code by replacing the title, headings, and list items to fit your desired recipe.
Credits: I followed the Odin Project HTML Foundations project "Recipes" which I will link below:
