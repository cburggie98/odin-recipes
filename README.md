# odin-recipes
This project is called odin-recipes and it is my first project!
This project aimed to create a simple chocolate chip cookie recipe in HTML. This project uses code such as headings, ordered lists, unordered lists, and also includes an image.
You can alter this code by replacing the title, headings, and list items to fit your desired recipe.
Credits: I followed the Odin Project HTML Foundations project "Recipes" which I will link below:
