        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This recipe will be <strong>without a doubt</strong> your new go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. This dough does not need to be chilled and can be mixed by hand! They are soft on the inside, yet cripsy and chewy on the outside.</p>
        <h3>Baking Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Properly mesure the flour</strong> - There is good reason for this tip, this is the main reason why most cookie recipes usually fail. If there is too much flour the cookies will be too dry. I would recommend measuring with a food scale if possible or spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level off with a flat knife.</li>
            <li><strong>The More Sugars the Merrier</strong> - This recipe uses both light brown sugar and granulated sugar. The molasses in the light brown sugar is what gives the cookies a soft, yet chewy texture. The granulated sugar is what gives the cookie the golden crispy ring around its edge (yum!)</li>
            <li><strong>DO NOT OVERBAKE</strong> - You ALWAYS want to pull the cookeis out when they are golden brown with a pale center that looks slightly underdone. The cookies will continue to bake outside the oven and as they cool the will flatten which gives you the perfect texture in the middle!</li>
